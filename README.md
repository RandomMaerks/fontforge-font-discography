# FontForge Font Discography

## Preamble

A list of open-source typefaces which are designed with FontForge and includes .sfd/.sfdir as source files. Mainly for FontForge users who want to quickly nagivate through different projects, examine them, and maybe contribute to some of them.

To contribute or request for a removal, you can make an issue or a pull request. Be sure to follow the same format.

## Criteria

- The fonts must be open-source, and the source should be accessible in some way.
- The fonts must be created or edited in FontForge.
- The source must include .sfd/.sfdir files. Other accompanying files can also be included.
- The license or the authors allow sharing/redistributing their fonts.
